        <p>Lord Jesus Christ. Help me to seek what everyone on this earth desires; To find happiness, but especially in You.</p>
<p>Why is it so hard for us to feel happy Lord?</p>
<p>How truly difficult is it for us?</p>
<p>Is it through Your Word we receive happiness?</p>
<p>I believe to be happy is to do the good will of others. There is no better love and happiness acheived than making yourself nothing, and putting others ahead of you instead. But yet, we still think and act selfishly. When we want to do things out of our own desires, we forget about everyone else.</p>
<p>Help us to be your servant Lord, and to be a doer of the faith. Allow us to suffer for others instead of oursevles. If we cannot be patient or humble in heart, we can never do these things. I feel so sad for those who seek happiness through the things of this world. For they do not know the lusts of the flesh and the lust of the eyes only bring them temporary fulfillment. But You Lord are the greatest of Love and fill our hearts with happiness; Not the things of this world. For our void within us is too large to fill without You, creator of all things. </p>
<p>Let us than, through Your Will, humble ourselves and serve others. For through this we not only put a smile on Your face Lord, but through helping another, we feel Your grace poured upon us, and satisfy all our needs and desires. Only then can we feel true happiness, not through temporary feelings we get from the things of this world. But remember, that through our humbleness, we don't puff our ego and feel pride within our hearts. Let us not practice righteousness in front of men, for we will have no reward in Heaven. Allow us then to fully seek You and to be Your servant, so that through Your guidance, we are filled with your grace and love. Be our source of happiness in everything we do, whether we are suffering or in perfect harmony with Your Will. </p>
