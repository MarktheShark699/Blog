        <p>-How do we know when the time is right for anything in life?</p>
<p>-Do we just act, and hope for the best?</p>
<p>-I've heard many people say that God's timing is always right, and I believe it, but how do we know when to act?</p>
<p>-Or do we just allow God to put whatever we need/want in our life at his own time?</p>
<p>Being patient is very critical when waiting for God's timing, whatever it may be for. But there are many times we act on our own will, and it, not being God's timing, may lead to a result not wanted.</p>
<p>-So this brings me back to the question of how do we know when it's God's timing?</p>
<p>-Is it a feeling?</p>
<p>-Do we just know what to do when the moment arises?</p>
<p>I believe through prayer and patience, when we ask for something from God, if it is His Will, we need to be able to trust in His timing, and whenever the moment arises, through guidance of the Holy Spirit, we will know how to react or what to do in that moment. We may try to take matters into our own hands and act without God, but if it isn't His timing, you will not receive what you sought after. Trust that He will provide when you need Him most, for God lives outside of time and knows when to take and give at any moment. Be humble in heart, to be ready to accept whatever it is you are seeking when His timing has arrived.</p>
