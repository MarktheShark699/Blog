        <p>-What is life, and what does it mean to live?</p>
      <p>-Does this earthly life matter?</p>
      <p>-If so, what matters and why does it matter?</p>
      <p>-If not, then is there another reason we are alive on this planet?</p>
      <p>-And if neither, are we just animals who have eveolved, and now live to have a "meaningful" life?</p>
      <p>Life is a gift given to us by Our Father, who created us out of nothing. He gives us purpose. Without Him, we would cease to be.</p>
      <p>-So what does this mean to us?</p>
      <p>That we should submit ourselves to Him, and His Will for ourselves. That is the way we should live; according to His Will. To live any other life would be a life without meaning, for He is the one who blesses us with our gifts and talents. It is He, out of His live for us, who created us in His own image and likeness. </p>
      <p>-How then, can we live a life without Him?</p>
      <p>Our earthly journey is to prepare us for Heaven. That is why our earthly life matters. For through the Catholic Church, being universal, given to us by the Son, and still being worked through His Mystical Body, we should all be living a life in helping each other grow in faith, and following God's Will. This is what life is. To seek the kingdom of God and His glory in everything that we do. </p>
      <p>Life without God is a life unlived. For without Him, we cannot posses who He is; Love</p>
