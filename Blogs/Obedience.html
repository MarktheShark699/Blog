    <section class="content">
        <p>-What is obedience?</p>
<p>-Is it not to submit ourselves to You Lord?</p>
<p>-Why is it so difficult to stand by You?</p>
<p>-Why is it so easy to serve or to submit to our fleshly desires?</p>
<p>-How weak is our obedience to You Lord?</p>
<p>Time and time again, we're so blinded by pride that we forget who we're here to serve. We turn to our fleshly desires and forget for the things we prayed we would or would not do. At the slightest bit of pleasure, we are so empty inside that we allow temptation to creep in and fill our minds so that our submission to God is hindered. Lord, fill my heart with Your word so I know the truth, and let me not be swayed from your service. 
<p>-What are we missing in our lives that is having us submit to the things of this world?</p>
<p>-Not only that, but why is it so easy to do so?</p>
<p>-Are you not the our Father, whom we want to serve and take care of us?</p>
<p>Yet, because of our selfishness and ignorance, we think we can figure things out on our own, without Your Will. 
<p>-How then can we submit ourselves to You when we think we already know the answer?; When we don't have any trust?</p>
<p>You then, are the One we should seek with all our heart and submit ourselves to. For through obedience, you give us the wisdom to live our lives like Your son, Jesus Christ. 

-St. Augustine,
