        <p>I’ve been struggling with the question of how are we supposed to serve Jesus (God) fully, and have Him in our presence when we’re constantly distracted with things such as work, raising a family, etc. I then asked the Holy Spirit to hopefully give me an answer. I don’t exactly remember what lead me to it, but I wanted to re-read or listen to “The Practice of the Presence of God” and I’ve been listening to it today. The Holy Spirit just made me realize that all I have to do is practice the presence of God in everything that I do, and follow His will in everything that I do. So whether that be through my work or raising a family, I can always practice His presence and fulfill His will through it. Also, during the same time of listening to the book, I’ve been reading and listening to the Catechism in a year, and in the Catechism, St. John Chrysostom says, “It’s always possible to offer fervent prayer even while walking in public or strolling or even while cooking.” In the book, brother Lawrence also mentions, “I turn my little omelet for the love of God…When I can do nothing else, it is enough to have picked up a straw for the love of God.” So anything we do, no matter how busy we are or no matter how little the thing is, we can practice the presence of God and conform to His Will in everything we do out of love for Him. Never think for a second that “my life is too busy to pray to God”. We always have a chance to speak to God, and practice being in His presence.</p>
