          - Why do I fear the feeling of being judged lord?
Surely it’s because I don't have full trust in you. Lord Jesus christ, you take all insecurities away when we have full faith and trust in you. Allow this feeling of fear and judgement be taken into you hand. "Do not judge, so you will not be judged".
- What does the devil instill in our hearts and minds to have this fear of judgement? Let us seek the Lord, for he will save you through his grace. Whether it be past situations that have been locked away in
our soul, let us give it all to God. "Whatever you ask for in prayer with faith, you will receive!
In finding and searching for You, do we feel peace, love, joy, humbleness, kindness. “fear not, for I am with you." You alone Lord are our healer and remedy. You allow us to be confident yet humble.
As I read today Lord, you said whoever trusts in You, and has no desire to stand by his own judgement, 
Will be free from the fear of men. So I pray Lord Jesus Christ, that I come to You in every decision, and that I don’t seek my own judgment. For You allow all things to happen. Let me keep my heart still within me, and keep my eyes only on You.
