        <p>-Why is it so easy to say that we love You, and yet, turn from You, or act like we don't need You in every part of our lives?
How easy it is for us to say we believe, but cannot do the simplest things You ask of us. 
How much do we love our sinful nature which constantly harms our soul, and leads us further from You. But we have the antedote Lord. 
Through Your Son's dying and suffering on the cross, He gave us the Sacrament of Confession to forgive us our sins. And yet, we let the evil one fill us with pride, or puff up our ego so that he can prevent us from going, and leave us in the filth which we are. Or maybe, we fell too ashamed or fear being judged, but You oh Lord love us so much that no sin is unforgivable, so let us turn to You, and rid the anxiety and fear the evil one instills in us. Let us acknowledge what Your son did for us, in order to be with Him for eternity in paradise. Let us also turn to our mother. For through her, she takes our prayers and cleanses them from the filth we have in our soul, to give to her son, our Lord. </p>
